#### Technologies used and the reasons why they used:

I've created this app using `vite` tool as it gives minimum scaffolding of the vuejs app. Then I went ahead and setup `Routing` using `vue-router`. For styling purposes I've used `tailwindcss` because it's a utility first framework and I can just focus on the UI and functionality of the app. (Fun fact: I can write my own styles too. I have started my career as a web designer so I am pretty much comfortable with it ðŸ˜Š)

For the one of the main components of the app, the slider I have used `vue3-carousel` library. For state management I've used `pinia` and for testing I've used `vitest`. I chose the above libraries because these were recommended by Vue itself.

I have also used `Typescript` to build this app. The reason being to show that I am comfortable with it ðŸ˜Š and ofcourse the benefits it brings to the code/repo. For network requests I have used `fetch` api. Also I have built this app using `composition API`.
